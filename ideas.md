# Feature Ideas (Not Yet Planned)

# Thoughts

- Have the user take a "learning style quiz" when they register for the first time to give more personalization to the user. The information can be saved in a User Profile and passed with the RAG context.
  Possible quiz style type questions:
  Learning Style, Pace/Detail, Tutor Tone, Academic Comfort

# Notes:

- These are _not commitments_
- Revisit every few weeks and move any solid ideas to the roadmap
